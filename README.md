# R-HomeRange
A repository for Home Range Analyses

The important file needed to run the analyses on home range estimators (MCP, Fixed Kernel, and LoCoH) is HomeRangeAnalysis.R. This has all the code and will allow for edits to the code to be made.

The HomeRangeAnalysis.html is a html version of the R-code, with additional information on each of the steps (created from the HomeRangeAnalysis.Rmd file).
